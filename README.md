## A Study Guide's Usage

The purpose of this Webpage is to ensure that there is a place to turn to upon encountering any complications or interferences when in the midst of working on any projects. 

Each section contains notes about its denoted topic, as outlined in the Study Guide Snapshot above. Simply click the link for the desired topic, to open the corresponding page of information. For example, upon clicking on DevTools, it will explain how the console opens, as well as observing JavaScript running, and how to make edits and saving updates. It can even list the aforementioned topics, and choose on our behalf, what to study first!

As mentioned, not only will there be solutions available, but also the opportunity to document any newly discovered resources and resolutions for future use. This will be a document that is in a constant state of evolution, that will be carried throughout this entire Coding Bootcamp journey, and possibly beyond.
